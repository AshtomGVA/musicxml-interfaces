# MusicXML Interfaces
MusicXML Interfaces currently targets TypeScript, JavaScript, and the D Programming Language. It is currently in alpha, so not all of MusicXML is typed yet, and there are many known bugs.

See the [getting started instructions](https://ripieno.github.io/musicxml-interfaces) or our browsable 
[MusicXML specification](https://ripieno.github.io/musicxml-interfaces/#spec).

## Contributing
I'm aware of many bugs, and the repo isn't contributor-friendly yet. When it is, there will be contributing instructions here.
